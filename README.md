# CodeChef Copy Test Case(Firefox Extension [:exclamation:not for android])

<br>

# Description :snail:

- After adding this extension , Whenever you open a coding problem on codechef, a copy button will be placed besides test input/output test case .You can simply click on it and copy the text.
- I used **javascipt** to manipulate the DOM as it is easy to resolve this problem in Js.
- **NOTE:-** Every problem on codechef doesn't follow same type of DOM (i.e position of test cases in DOM) , Sometime you can find that copy button doesn't show up instead an alert came up.
  - :raising_hand:In this case, please raise an issue by adding that problem link. This will help to acknowledge the error asap and fix them.

# Motivation :fist:

I am also a competitve coder. Unlike codeforces , codechef lacks the feature of copying test cases using a simple copy button . It is very annoying to copy by dragging the mouse .
<br>

# How to Install :point_down:

<br>

# How to Use :zzz:

- Open any coding problem on codechef in a <span style="color:red"> <strong>new tab</strong> </span>.
- Wait for atmost 3 seconds . Copy button will appear besides test case . Click and Copy. :boom::boom:
